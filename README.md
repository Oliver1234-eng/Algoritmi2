# 1. Write a program that calculates the total price of products ordered from Amazon. The delivery cost depends on the location: it's $5 for the United States, $7 for Europe, and $9 for other countries. The user enters the product price and their location (America, Europe, other countries) from the keyboard, and the program displays the total product price.
# 2. Write a program that calculates the cost of a phone call based on its duration in seconds. The telecommunications company charges calls as follows: fixed costs are 100 RSD, and the rest is described as follows: call duration 1 - 500s, price per second 0.1, call duration 501 - 800s, price per second 0.05, call duration 801+s, price per second 0.005. The user enters the call duration in seconds, and the program displays the total call cost.
# 3. Write a program that allows the user to enter the number of apartments they want to compare prices for, and then enter the prices of the apartments. The program then calculates the average apartment price and displays how much each individual price differs from the average.
# 4. Allow the user to enter numbers until they enter -1. After that, the program should display the total number of entered odd numbers.
# 5. Write a function that takes an integer as its first parameter and an array of numbers as its second parameter. The function finds the element in the array that is closest to the entered number, replaces the found element with the entered number, and displays it.
# 6. In a supermarket queue, there are n customers. The time the cashier serves each customer is given by the array t[0], t[1], ..., t[n - 1]. Write a function that determines the waiting time for each customer and then displays the result. For the array [4, 9, 10, 22, 13], the waiting times should be as follows: 4, 13, 23, 45, 58.
# 7. Write a function that calculates the average of numbers entered by the user. First, enter the number of numbers to be added, then enter all the numbers, and finally, display the average value.
# 8. Write a function that calculates an approximation of Pi as a partial sum of the series: 4/1 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9... The function expects the number of terms in the series to be summed and returns the calculated value.
# 9. A positive integer x > 2 is prime if there is no number in the interval [2, sqrt(x)] that evenly divides x. Write a function that checks whether a number is prime. The function should take the number to be checked as input and return true if it is prime and false if it is not.
# 10. Write a program that simulates the operation of a private parking lot. The driver enters how many hours they were parked and whether they are a club member. If they are a member, they pay fixed costs of 100 RSD; if not, they pay 200 RSD. The parking fee per hour for the first hour is 200 RSD, for the second hour 150 RSD, for the third hour 100 RSD, and after the fourth hour, the price is 50 RSD. The program should allow an arbitrary number of such inputs. When the user chooses to exit the program, it should display the number of drivers and the total revenue.
